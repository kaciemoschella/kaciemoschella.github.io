        <p>Wildlife and traffic do not mix. Anyone who keeps an eye on the verges while driving along a country road knows that. Yet such carnage brings zoologists a unique opportunity.</p>

        <p>Counting roadkill is a rough-and-ready way of sampling local animal populations, and is the basis of "citizen science" endeavors such as The Road Lab, in which members of the United Kingdom's general public report what they have found dead on the road and where. However, Pablo Medrano-Vizcaino and Santiago Espinosa at the Catholic University of Ecuador have taken this matter further by going to look for themselves. And as they report in Biotropica, monitoring roadkill may yield information about creatures that are otherwise elusive.</p>

        <p>Once a week for six months, Medrano-Vizcaino and Espinosa surveyed three 33-km segments of road around tropical rainforests and mountain ranges near the Ecuadorian national parks Cayambe Coca and Sumaco Napo-Galeras. Each time they came across a dead animal, they stopped and photographed it, noting its GPS coordinates and identifying it as accurately as possible. If they could not achieve a field identification, they collected the carcass and brought it back to their laboratory for further analysis.</p>

        <p>In total, they found 445 specimens. Some of the carcasses, such as the 153 opossums included in their data, were the sort of large critters that the average passer-by might notice. But many were not.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-6">
      
      <p>There were, for instance, 43 amphibians. Frogs are commonly found in tropical areas, yet by and large these were not frogs. Rather, some 80% of them were caecilians, a little-understood group of wormlike burrowing animals.</p>

      <p>Ecuador harbors 24 species of caecilian. Exactly which of these were represented in the researchers' collection is hazy, as individual species of caecilian require specialist identification. But studying roadkill might be a way of adding to knowledge about them.</p>

      <p>More extraordinary than this, among the 88 reptiles seen by Medrano-Vizcaino and Espinosa, one was a snake previously unknown to science. They also found a northern tiger cat, a species thought to be on the brink of extinction. A sampling method that relies upon finding endangered animal species already dead is obviously suboptimal.</p>

      <p>Yet Medrano-Vizcaino and Espinosa hope that one outcome of their work might be to identify roadkill hotspots, which would encourage scientists to find ways to discourage animals from going there. Although, that could be tricky, as the data they have collected suggests these hotspots are often bridges over rivers. If the creatures themselves are using these as crossing points, deterring them from doing so may be difficult.</p>
