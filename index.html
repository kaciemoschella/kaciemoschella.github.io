        <p>Anyone who keeps an eye on the verges while driving along a country road knows that wildlife and traffic do not mix. But such carnage brings biologists a unique opportunity. </p>

        <p>Counting roadkill is a rough-and-ready way of sampling local animal populations, and is the basis of “citizen science” endeavors such as The Road Lab, in which members of the United Kingdom's general public report what they have found dead on the road and where. However, ecologists Pablo Medrano-Vizcaino and Santiago Espinosa at the Catholic University of Ecuador have taken this matter further by going to look for themselves. And as they report in Biotropica, monitoring roadkill may yield information about creatures that are otherwise elusive. </p>

        <p>Medrano-Vizcaino's dataset of roadkill in the Ecuadorian Andes is a culmination of his eight years of studying road ecology, a niche scientific field in which researchers analyze dead animals in order to sample an area's biodiversity. </p>

        <p>“There was no research in Latin America about this topic,” Medrano-Vizcaino explains. “And in Ecuador, there was not even one study about it.”</p>

        <p>Road ecologists such as Medrano-Vizcaino view the study of roadkill as a way to reduce the impact of roads on surrounding wildlife. Since beginning his research nine years ago, he has founded REMFA (Red Ecuatoriana para el Monitoreo de Fauna Atropellada), a citizen science endeavor in which everyday-people report on when and where they see roadkill. Medrano-Vizcaino hopes that through identifying areas with high concentrations of roadkill, people may convince their elected officials to take wildlife concentration into consideration when funding roadwork. </p>

        <p>“It's impossible to stop building roads,” he says, “but you can do it in a friendlier way.”</p>

      <p>“It's impossible to stop building roads,” he says, “but you can do it in a friendlier way.”</p>

      <p>Once a week for six months, Medrano-Vizcaino and Espinosa surveyed three 33-km segments of road around tropical rainforests and mountain ranges near the Ecuadorian national parks Cayambe Coca and Sumaco Napo-Galeras. Each time they came across a dead animal, they stopped and photographed it, noting its GPS coordinates, and identified it as accurately as possible. If they could not achieve a field identification, they collected the carcass and brought it back to their laboratory for further analysis.</p>

      <p>In total, they found 445 specimens. Some of the carcasses, such as the 153 opossums included in their data, were the sort of large critters that the average passer-by might notice. But many were not. </p>

      <p>There were, for instance, 43 amphibians. Frogs are commonly found in tropical areas, yet by and large these were not frogs. Rather, some 80% of them were caecilians, a little-understood group of wormlike burrowing animals. </p>

      <p>Ecuador harbors 24 unique species of caecilian. Exactly which of these were represented in the researchers' collection is hazy, as individual species of caecilian require specialist identification. But studying roadkill might be a way of adding to knowledge about them. </p>
      
      <p>More extraordinary than this, among the 88 reptiles seen by Medrano-Vizcaino and Espinosa, one was a snake previously unknown to science. They also identified a northern tiger cat, a species thought to be on the brink of extinction.</p>
      
      <p>“It was completely unexpected,” Medrano-Vizcaino explains. “We didn't know that there could be species that are undescribed by science, yet affected by roads.”</p>
      
      <p>A sampling method that relies upon finding endangered animal species already dead is obviously suboptimal. Yet up until this point, wildlife ecologists have been indirectly putting stress upon animals by moving into their habitats and taking their blood. As Medrano-Vizcaino explains, “If you take advantage of animals that are on roads, you are not causing any negative environmental impact.” </p>
      
      <p>Another possible downside of studying roadkill is having to identify carcasses in decayed states. About 60 roadkill specimens recorded in the Ecuadorian Andes research are simply labeled “mammal” because the quality of the roadkill defied species identification. In order to combat this issue, Medrano-Vizcaino and Espinosa employed DNA experts in order to identify animals as accurately as possible.</p>
      
      <p>Medrano-Vizcaino and Espinosa hope that one outcome of their work might be to identify roadkill hotspots, which would encourage scientists to find ways to discourage animals from going there. That could be tricky, as the data they have collected suggests these hotspots are often bridges over rivers; if the creatures themselves are using these as crossing points, deterring them from doing so may be difficult. However, spreading awareness about roadkill data may convince future policymakers to advocate for highway-building in places with less biodiversity. </p>
      
      <p>Medrano-Vizcaino is continuing to identify roadkill throughout Latin America; his most recent research, published in August 2023, analyzes road and landscape features commonly linked to wildlife mortality in the Amazon. A commonality that connects all of Medrano-Vizcaino's data is that larger birds and mammals are more vulnerable to road death than smaller ones.</p>
      
      <p>“Animals are dying because of high road density,” Medrano-Vizcaino says. “A lot of Latin America's wildlife diversity is becoming vulnerable, and still no studies are being developed. This should be an area for further research.” </p>
